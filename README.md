# Healthcare
Objective: Analyze patient satisfaction and healthcare costs to provide insights for improving services and reducing costs.
The dataset could include:
Patient ID
Age
Gender
Treatment Type
Treatment Cost
Satisfaction Score (1-10)
Treatment Duration
Follow-up Visits
Steps:

Data Collection:
Gathered data from MedTourEasyâ€™s records or create a sample dataset in Google Sheets or Excel.
Data Cleaning:
Ensured there are no missing values.
Corrected any inconsistencies in data entries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Used pivot tables to summarize data.
Created charts and graphs to visualize:
Average treatment cost by treatment type.
Average satisfaction score by treatment type.
Correlation between treatment cost and satisfaction score.
Distribution of treatment duration.
Data Analysis:
Calculated key metrics such as average cost, average satisfaction score, and average treatment duration.
Identified trends and patterns in the data.
Used conditional formatting to highlight key insights.
Reporting:
Created a dashboard in Google Sheets or Excel to present my findings.
Included charts, graphs, and key metrics.
Provided recommendations based on my analysis, such as:
Which treatments have the highest satisfaction scores.
Areas where costs can be reduced without affecting patient satisfaction.
Suggestions for improving patient satisfaction.
Tools and Technologies:

Spreadsheet Software: Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel
Features: Pivot tables, charts, graphs, conditional formatting
Deliverables:

Cleaned and organized dataset.
EDA with visualizations.
Analytical report with key insights and recommendations.
Interactive dashboard.
Results:
Patient Satisfaction:
Overall Satisfaction Increase: Calculate the percentage increase in patient satisfaction scores before and after implementing the project.
Example: If the average satisfaction score increased from 7.5 to 8.5 out of 10, the increase is (\frac{8.5 - 7.5}{7.5} \times 100 = 13.33%).
Patients Helped: Determine the number of patients who reported improved satisfaction.
Example: If 200 out of 300 patients reported higher satisfaction, then 66.67% of patients were helped.
Cost Reduction:
Average Cost Reduction: Calculate the percentage reduction in treatment costs.
Example: If the average treatment cost decreased from $1,000 to $850, the reduction is (\frac{1000 - 850}{1000} \times 100 = 15%).
Total Savings: Calculate the total cost savings for the healthcare provider.
Example: If 300 treatments were performed, the total savings would be (300 \times (1000 - 850) = $45,000).
Example Summary:
Patient Satisfaction: Increased by 13.33%, with 66.67% of patients reporting higher satisfaction.
Cost Reduction: Average treatment cost reduced by 15%, resulting in total savings of $45,000.
Impact:
Improved Patient Experience: Higher satisfaction scores indicate better patient experiences and potentially better health outcomes.
Financial Benefits: Significant cost savings can be reinvested into improving healthcare services or reducing patient fees.
